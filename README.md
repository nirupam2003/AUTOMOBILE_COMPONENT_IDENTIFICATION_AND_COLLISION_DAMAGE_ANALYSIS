# AUTOMOBILE_COMPONENT_IDENTIFICATION_AND_COLLISION_DAMAGE_ANALYSIS
This project aims to develop an advanced system that employs cutting-edge image processing and artificial intelligence techniques to accurately identify and categorize damages incurred by vehicles. Automobile damage analysis plays a vital role in various organizations, offering multifaceted benefits tailored to their specific needs. 

# NOTE
the parts.pt in python file is the model weights of car parts developed using yolo, this weights can be developed by annotating all the car parts of any dataset of car images.
and the type_of_damage.pt is the model weights of the type of damage on the vechile for eg: scratch, dent ,broken etc. 
2 yaml file's are shared for your understanding of what classes have been used in this project please refer.

please refer how yaml files are made so that the given paths can be altered in the given file according to your system's path.
also how to train a model in yolo so that you can train model for both parts.pt and type_damage.pt 

change the paths for loading the model in the code for running the program which is cardamage.py.
this particular cardamage.py has be run with the help of postman
